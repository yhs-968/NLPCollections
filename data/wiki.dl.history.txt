According to a survey,[4] the expression Deep Learning was introduced to the Machine Learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986,[22] and later to Artificial Neural Networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons.[23] In 2005, Faustino Gomez and Jürgen Schmidhuber published a paper on learning deep POMDPs[24] through neural networks for reinforcement learning. In 2006, a publication by Hinton, Osindero, and Teh[25][26] drew attention by showing how many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then fine-tuning it using supervised backpropagation.[27] The paper referred to learning for deep belief nets. A Google Ngram chart shows that the usage of the term has taken off since 2000.[28] The underlying concepts and many techniques, however, date to earlier decades.

The first general, working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer perceptrons was published by Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965.[10] A 1971 paper described a deep network with 8 layers trained by the group method of data handling algorithm.[11]

These ideas were implemented in a computer identification system by the World School Council London called "Alpha", which demonstrated the learning process.[citation needed]

Other deep learning working architectures, specifically those built for computer vision, began with the Neocognitron introduced by Fukushima in 1980.[29] In 1989, LeCun et al. applied the standard backpropagation algorithm, which had been around as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation since 1970,[30][31][32][33] to a deep neural network with the purpose of recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. While the algorithm worked the training time was an impractical 3 days.[34]

By 1991 such systems were used for recognizing isolated 2-D hand-written digits, while recognizing 3-D objects was done by matching 2-D images with a handcrafted 3-D object model. Weng et al. suggested that a human brain does not use a monolithic 3-D object model and in 1992 they published Cresceptron,[35][36][37] a method for performing 3-D object recognition directly from cluttered scenes. Cresceptron is a cascade of layers similar to Neocognitron. But while Neocognitron required a human programmer to hand-merge features, Cresceptron automatically learned an open number of unsupervised features in each layer, where each feature is represented by a convolution kernel. Cresceptron segmented each learned object from a cluttered scene through back-analysis through the network. Max pooling, now often adopted by deep neural networks (e.g. ImageNet tests), was first used in Cresceptron to reduce the position resolution by a factor of (2x2) to 1 through the cascade for better generalization.

In 1992, Schmidhuber used unsupervised pre-training for deep hierarchies of data-compressing recurrent neural networks, and showed its benefits for speeding up supervised learning.[12][4]

In 1994, André C. P. L. F. de Carvalho, together with Fairhurst and Bisset, published experimental results of a multi-layer boolean neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a self-organising feature extraction neural network module followed by a classification neural network module, which were independently trained.[38]

In 1995, Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed with Dayan and Hinton.[39] However, training took two days. Many factors contribute to the slow speed, including the vanishing gradient problem analyzed in 1991 by Hochreiter.[40][41]

Simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of ANNs' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.

Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs have been explored for many years.[42][43][44] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively.[45] Key difficulties have been methodologically analyzed, including gradient diminishing[40] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models.[46][47] Additional difficulties were the lack of big training data and weaker computing power.

Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA, SRI conducted research on deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition. Heck's speaker recognition team achieved the first significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing as demonstrated in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation and later published in the journal of Speech Communication.[48] While SRI experienced success with deep neural networks in speaker recognition, they were unsuccessful in demonstrating similar success in speech recognition. One decade later, Hinton and Deng collaborated with each other and then with colleagues across groups at University of Toronto, Microsoft, Google and IBM, igniting a renaissance of deep feedforward neural networks in speech recognition.[49][50][51][52]

Many aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called Long short-term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997.[53] LSTM RNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn "Very Deep Learning" tasks[2] that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps ago, which is important for speech. In 2003, LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.[54] Later it was combined with connectionist temporal classification (CTC)[55] in stacks of LSTM RNNs.[56] In 2015, Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which they made available through Google Voice Search.[57]

In 2006, Hinton and Salakhutdinov showed how a many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then fine-tuning it using supervised backpropagation.[58]

Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved.[49][59][60] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been superseded for ASR by CTC[55] for LSTM.[53][57][61][62][63][64][65] but are more successful in computer vision.

The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US.[66] Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010.

In late 2009, Li Deng invited Geoff Hinton to work with him and colleagues at Microsoft to apply deep learning to speech recognition. They co-organized the 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition.[67] The workshop was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that the big-compute, big-data era warranted a serious try of deep neural nets (DNN). It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets.[51] However, Deng et al. at Microsoft soon after discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more advanced generative model-based speech recognition systems. This finding was verified by other research groups subsequently.[49][68] Further, the nature of recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was found to be characteristically different,[50][67] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition players.[8][69][70]

Advances in hardware enabled the renewed interest in deep learning. In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[71] That year, Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning. While there Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[72] In particular, powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) are well-suited for the matrix/vector math involved in machine learning.[73][74] GPUs speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude, reducing running times from weeks to days.[75][76] Specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient D processing.[77]
